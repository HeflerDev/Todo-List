## About

### Introduction

Webpage built with *Javascript* that works as an Todo-like app, were you can
create *projects*, *tasks* for these projects and *todos* to each task. <br>
This project counts towards Microverse graduation, and has the basic functionality
that was required it to have, it's design is simple and uses *localStorage* to hold
user data. <br>

### Future Updates 

Tough the side content is still very basically used, I aim to implement an sort of
gamified todo-list, making difficulties and tasks give the 'player' experience <br>
points. <br>
My intention is to make time-tracking and organization experience more fun.
